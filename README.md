## Example of building the container for use in minikube

Setup docker env
```eval $(minikube-docker-env)```

Do a docker build of the container
```build -t simple-angular:v1 simple-angular-app/.```

Create a kube deployment
```kubectl run test-angular --image=simple-angular:v1 --port=4200```

Check deployment status
```kubectl get pods``

Expose the pod to external requests
```kubectl expose deployment test-angular â€”type=LoadBalancer```

Check the service is up
```kubectl get services```

Open the service in the browser
```minikube service test-angular```

Updating the deployed image
1. rebuild docker image -> ```build -t simple-angular:v2 simple-angular-app/.```
2. set image for kube node -> ```kubectl set image deployment/test-angular test-angular=simple-angular:v2```
3. Open new version -> ```minikube service test-angular```
